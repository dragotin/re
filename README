re is your tool to organize weekly reports employees often have
to write to their management.

If you type 're', it opens $EDITOR with the work report of the
current week. The work reports are collected in a directory in
the home dir.

To get started, copy the file rerc.template from the source
directory to $HOME/.rerc and edit the data within accordingly.
Be careful with the syntax, the rerc must contain valid perl
hash code, ie. value => key, separated by colons.

In the rerc there is a template for new report files. The strings
SENDER, WEEK and YEAR are replaced automatically.

re -l opens the report from last week.
re -w <number> opens the week number of the current year.
re I have just done somthing cool, and it takes me less than a minute to add it to my weekly report.
re RED: we gonna die
re AMBER: save me
re UPCOMING: mabye some day I'll do this.

Have fun and make your manager happy!
